## Data Fetching in React Examples...

This GitHub repo is to serve as examples to my article on data fetching in React on Dev.to.

[Dev.to Article](https://dev.to/char_carr_dev/6-approaches-for-data-fetching-in-react-1ec3)

### How to Navigate Repo

Each 'Approach' number in the article has a coordinating component in the src/components directory that is prefixed with 'Example'.

**Note** for the last three examples there are additional files to review within this application (wrappers, redux store, hooks, etc.)

Hope this helps!
